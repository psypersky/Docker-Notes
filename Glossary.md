__TTY__
Early user terminals connected to computers were electromechanical teleprinters or teletypewriters (TeleTYpewriter, TTY)

__Union file system__
Union file systems, or UnionFS, are file systems that operate by creating layers, making them very lightweight and fast. Docker uses union file systems to provide the building blocks for containers.

__virtual machine__
A virtual machine is a program that emulates a complete computer and imitates dedicated hardware. It shares physical hardware resources with other users but isolates the operating system. The end user has the same experience on a Virtual Machine as they would have on dedicated hardware.

Compared to containers, a virtual machine is heavier to run, provides more isolation, gets its own set of resources and does minimal sharing.
