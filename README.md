# Docker Node.js Postgres Example Notes

__Example 1__   
Simple Example running Node.js in container copying the code at building time

__Example 2__   
Our first attempt to Dockerize a node.js app, very very wrong, this is a reference of how NOT to do it

__Example 3__   
Node.js app running in a container with the code shared between the host and the container, Postgresql running in another container and both containers running on the same Docker Network using docker-compose, success! :D
